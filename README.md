# Auto-LinkedIn
A script in python that uses Selenium to automate the creation and posting on the LinkedIn website 

This script alows the creation of a post and posting it on your account. Simply input on the code your username and password and the script will open your chosen browser, log in your account, write what you wish to post and post it!

### Make sure to check how much you want automated

If don't wish for the script to automatically post and have a chance to correct any mispelling or text alignment, or even add pictures or hashtags, you should coment or delete the line that clicks on the 'post' button. Alternatively, if you wish to automate all the process on the terminal and run the script in the background, use the input comand and uncomment the lines that allow it, jsut make sure everything is running as expected before choosing to run it.
